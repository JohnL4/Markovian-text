Silly little Python script to generate random gibberish based on sample text.

The idea is that it builds frequency tables of "what's next" based on "what came before".  You pick the length of "what
came before" (/k/).

So, if you have a sample input file that looks like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Albertville
Farmville
Farmingdale
Wilmington
#+END_EXAMPLE

and you manage to build the random sequence "ill", you'll definitely get "e" as your next letter (if /k/ = 3).

But if you build the random sequence "ing", then you might get a "d" or "t" as the next letter (50% chance).  Ditto
"arm" leading to either "i" or "v".

Likewise, if you feed it the Gettysburg Address, you'll some Lincolnesque gibberish (/k/ = 4 seems to be a good
minimum).

For town names, you probably want /k/ = 3 and =--preserveLineBreaks=, but for just a stream of text, you probably don't
want that.
